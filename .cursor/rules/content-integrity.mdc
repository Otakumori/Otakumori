# Content Integrity Standards

## Approved Microcopy Preservation

### Core Principle

**NEVER alter approved microcopy** without explicit user approval. Preserve exact wording, punctuation, and tone.

### Protected Content Categories

#### Game Descriptions

```typescript
// PROTECTED - Do not modify
const GAME_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  'samurai-petal-slice': "Draw the Tetsusaiga's arc…",
  'anime-memory-match': 'Recall the faces bound by fate.',
  'bubble-pop-gacha': 'Pop for spy-craft secrets…',
  'rhythm-beat-em-up': "Sync to the Moon Prism's pulse.",
  'petal-storm-rhythm': 'Stormy rhythm playlist—precision timing for petals.',
  'memory-match': 'Flip cards and match pairs. Perfect recall earns bonuses.',
  'bubble-girl': 'Spawn bubbles, float and score. Sandbox or challenge mode.',
  'bubble-ragdoll': 'Toss the ragdoll into bubbles. Survive the chaos.',
  blossomware: 'Chaotic micro-sessions—keep your petal streak alive.',
  'dungeon-of-desire': 'Descend into the dungeon. Survive rooms and claim rewards.',
  'maid-cafe-manager': 'Manage shifts and keep guests smiling.',
  'thigh-coliseum': 'Enter the arena. Win rounds and advance the bracket.',
  'quick-math': 'Answer fast. Pressure builds with each correct streak.',
  'puzzle-reveal': 'Clear the fog to reveal the art. Watch your energy.',
  'petal-samurai': 'Slash petals with style. Master storm and endless modes.',
};
```

#### Navigation & UI Text

```typescript
// PROTECTED - Do not modify
const UI_MICROCOPY = {
  site_tagline: 'Anime x gaming shop + play — petals, runes, rewards.',
  hero_title: 'Welcome Home, Traveler — Otaku-mori',
  soapstone_cta: 'Leave a sign for fellow travelers',
  search_placeholder: "What're ya buyin'?",
  footer_copyright: "© 2024 Otaku-mori. All petals accounted for. Don't go hollow.",
  footer_trademark: 'Otakumori ™ made with ♡',
  gamecube_select: 'Select a face to navigate',
  auth_soapstone: 'Sign in to leave a sign for fellow travelers',
  auth_praise: 'Sign in to send praise to other travelers',
  auth_wishlist: 'Sign in to add items to your wishlist',
  auth_trade: 'Sign in to present offers in the Scarlet Bazaar',
  auth_community: 'Sign in to participate in community discussions',
};
```

#### Character Quotes & References

```typescript
// PROTECTED - Preserve attribution and exact wording
const CHARACTER_QUOTES = {
  edward_elric: "I didn't lose. Just ran out of health. – Edward Elric",
  // Add other character quotes as they appear
};
```

### Content Guidelines

#### Tone & Voice

- **Nostalgic gaming references** - Maintain otaku culture authenticity
- **Playful technical terms** - "petals", "runes", "travelers", "signs"
- **Dark Souls inspiration** - "Don't go hollow", soapstone messaging
- **Anime references** - Character quotes and series references

#### Formatting Standards

- **Em dashes** (—) for dramatic pauses, not hyphens (-)
- **Smart quotes** (" ") when contextually appropriate
- **Ellipses** (…) for trailing thoughts, not three periods (...)
- **Apostrophes** (') properly formatted in contractions

#### Brand Terminology

- **Otaku-mori** - Primary brand name (hyphenated)
- **Otakumori** - Trademark version (no hyphen)
- **GameCube** - Proper capitalization for interface references
- **Mini-Games** - Hyphenated in navigation
- **Cherry Blossom** - Full term, not abbreviated

### Implementation Rules

#### Variable Naming

```typescript
// Use descriptive constants for protected content
const SOAPSTONE_COMPOSE_PLACEHOLDER = 'Compose a sign…';
const PRAISE_MODAL_TITLE = 'Send praise to fellow travelers';
const WISHLIST_ADD_SUCCESS = 'Added to wishlist';
```

#### Content Sources

- Import from centralized constants file
- Never hardcode strings in components
- Use translation keys even for English-only content
- Maintain content audit trail

#### Review Process

- **Content changes require approval** - Tag user for microcopy changes
- **Preserve context** - Don't change meaning while fixing formatting
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify content appears correctly across devices
- **Document changes** - Track any approved modifications

### Sanitization Rules

- Fix technical issues (encoding, extra quotes) without changing meaning
- Normalize quote styles consistently
- Preserve intentional stylistic choices
- Never auto-correct approved creative writing
