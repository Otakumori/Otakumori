# Storyboard Implementation

## Document-Driven Development

### Storyboard Process

Convert documents under `docs/storyboards/*.md` into concrete UI/logic:

- Keep copy in `lib/i18n/en.ts`
- Generate component stubs with proper TypeScript types
- Create routes with proper SEO metadata
- Generate test scaffolding

### Implementation Requirements

Each storyboard must emit:

- **Acceptance checklist**: measurable criteria for completion
- **E2E test seeds**: Playwright test outline
- **Component hierarchy**: React component structure
- **API contracts**: Zod schemas for data flow

### Quality Gates

- All interactive elements have `data-test` attributes
- All copy comes from i18n constants
- All routes have proper metadata
- All components have TypeScript interfaces

## Storyboard Standards

### Structure

Each storyboard must include:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## User Stories

- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1 (measurable)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (testable)

## UI Components

- ComponentName: description and props
- Layout: responsive behavior

## API Requirements

- Endpoints needed
- Data schemas
- Error handling

## E2E Test Flow

1. User action
2. Expected result
3. Success criteria
```

### Implementation Tracking

- Each storyboard has implementation status
- Components track completion percentage
- E2E tests validate acceptance criteria
- Performance budgets enforced
