# Homepage Products Status

## Current Status: ✅ READY (Awaiting Printify Data)

### Implementation Complete

The homepage shop section (`app/(site)/home/ShopSection.tsx`) is **fully implemented** and ready to display products. It includes:

- ✅ API integration with `/api/v1/products/featured` and `/api/products` endpoints
- ✅ Fallback handling for empty/blocked responses
- ✅ Proper error boundaries and loading states
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (1/2/3 columns)
- ✅ Product cards with images, titles, descriptions, prices, availability
- ✅ Hover effects and animations
- ✅ "View All Products" button
- ✅ Feature flag integration (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SHOP=1`)

### Why Products Don't Show

Products will appear on the homepage automatically once **Printify API** returns product data. Currently:

1. **Printify Credentials Required**: The API routes need valid Printify credentials:
   - `PRINTIFY_API_TOKEN` (in `.env` or `.env.local`)
   - `PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID` (in `.env` or `.env.local`)

2. **Product Sync**: Products must be:
   - Created in your Printify dashboard
   - Published to your connected store
   - Available for sale

### Testing Locally

To see products on the homepage:

```bash
# 1. Add Printify credentials to .env.local
PRINTIFY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id_here

# 2. Restart dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Visit http://localhost:3000
# Products should now appear in the Shop section
```

### Fallback Behavior

When no products are available, the homepage displays:

- **Message**: "Shop Coming Soon" or "No Products Available"
- **CTA Button**: "Explore Shop" (links to `/shop`)
- **Design**: Maintains glassmorphic theme consistency

### Feature Flag

Shop section is controlled by:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SHOP=1  # enabled
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SHOP=0  # disabled (shows ShopTeaser fallback)
```

### Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to test without Printify:

1. Create mock product data in `/api/v1/products/featured/route.ts`
2. Return sample products from the API
3. Products will display immediately

**Conclusion**: The homepage products feature is **production-ready**. It's waiting for Printify API data to populate the product catalog.
