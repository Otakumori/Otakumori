## Current Status

⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER**: These images need to be created or sourced.

The homepage will show a placeholder until these images are added.

## Usage

The `CherryTree` component automatically cycles through these images every 30 seconds, creating a smooth cross-fade effect between seasons.

## Seasonal Palettes

Each season has its own color palette that affects:
- Petal colors
- Burst effects
- Site-wide accents
- UI elements

The palettes are defined in the `CherryTree` component and can be customized.
