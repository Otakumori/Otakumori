# 📋 Character Improvements TODO

## 🎯 What Needs to Be Done:

### **PHASE 1: Fix Current Character** (30 min)
- [ ] Fix syntax error in EnhancedProceduralCharacter
- [ ] Make face look human (nose bridge, eye sockets, cheekbones)
- [ ] Fix lips (actual volume, not flat torus)
- [ ] Add more hair detail (individual strands)
- [ ] Perfect breast shape (better curves)
- [ ] Fix arm positioning (down, not up!)
- [ ] Add hands and feet

### **PHASE 2: Sara Model Integration** (When GLB ready)
- [ ] Export Sara model to GLB (online converter or Blender)
- [ ] Load GLB in Sara Creator
- [ ] Hook up morphs to sliders
- [ ] Apply blonde hair material
- [ ] Add jiggle physics to bones
- [ ] Test all sliders

### **PHASE 3: Advanced Features** (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Face: Eye sockets, cheekbones, jaw definition
- [ ] Hair: Individual strand system, shine, flow
- [ ] Breasts: Perfect teardrop, realistic nipples
- [ ] Body: Muscle definition, skin creases
- [ ] Skin: Subsurface scattering shader
- [ ] Accessories: Glasses, jewelry, etc.

### **PHASE 4: Male Variant** (1 hour)
- [ ] Masculinity slider (0 = female, 1 = male)
- [ ] Chest flattening morphs
- [ ] Shoulder broadening
- [ ] Hip narrowing
- [ ] Facial masculinization

## 🔥 Estimated Total Time:

- **With Sara model**: 4-5 hours to perfection
- **Pure procedural**: 6-8 hours to match quality

---

## ✨ Current Blockers:

1. **EnhancedProceduralCharacter has syntax error** → Fix in agent mode
2. **Sara model needs GLB export** → Use online converter
3. **Need more geometry detail** → Build custom mesh functions
