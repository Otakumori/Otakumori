# Otaku-mori • Guardrails (DO NOT VIOLATE)

## Hard rules
- Never delete, rename, or move a file unless explicitly instructed **in this session**.
- Modify only files necessary to fulfill the spec; prefer additive edits over destructive changes.
- Do not duplicate pages/components. If something exists, improve it in-place.
- Keep all public asset paths and filenames exactly as-is (`/public/assets/**` is immutable).
- Before writing, search the repo for existing implementations and reuse them.
- If you change an import path (only with explicit approval), update **all** importers.

## Output requirements
- At the end, print a `CHANGESET` block listing every created/edited file with a one-line reason.
- If a task implies delete/rename, STOP and ask for confirmation after listing:
  1) files affected, 2) all importers/usages, 3) proposed new paths.

## Quality gates (must pass before you say "done")
- `pnpm typecheck` has **zero** errors.
- `pnpm lint` has **zero** warnings.
- `pnpm build` succeeds.
- No console warnings in dev/preview.
- No CSP violations.
- No duplicate components/pages.
- No changes to `/public/assets/**`.

## Definition of Done (sitewide)
- Real data from `/api/v1/...` (no mocks) across all routes.
- Home: fixed tree (no parallax), trunk center aligned left, invisible petal anchor; petals POST to `/api/v1/petals/collect`.
- Visual system: purple abyss, glass panels, no emojis, accessible, responsive.
- Shop→Cart→Checkout works with Clerk/Stripe; Admin gated; Blog & Games correct.
