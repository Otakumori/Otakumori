# 🔧 Quick Fixes for Character Quality

## 🎯 The Current Issue:

The Ultimate Creator is showing a **basic white character** instead of the enhanced blonde one. This is likely because `EnhancedProceduralCharacter` has a syntax error.

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes):

### **Use the working Blonde Character component:**

**Switch to agent mode** and I'll:
1. Fix the syntax error in `EnhancedProceduralCharacter.tsx`
2. Or swap to use `BlondeAnimeCharacter.tsx` (which we know works)
3. Test immediately
